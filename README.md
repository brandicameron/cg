## Description

Sometimes service business sites can be, well, a bit boring — but we added a bit of whimsy with this one. Please enjoy the floating cleaning bubbles as you scroll & explore all the exceptional cleaning packages this company has to offer.

## Things Learned:

- This was the first project I used Sass on.
- This was the project where I learned that I don't care for nesting in Sass — it encouraged me to be lazy and nest instead of creating explicit classes. Had to nip that in the bud.
